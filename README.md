This is my personal development sandbox for building vibe code applications. 
Currently focused on **Chronos Tracker** and other agent-led experiments.

## 🛰️ Current Missions
- [**Chronos Tracker:**](Google-Antigravity-ZeroG-Lab/Chronos-tracker/README.md) Simple time tracking tool. First one I'm testing Antigravity with. Final aim is to upload it to anroid appstore
